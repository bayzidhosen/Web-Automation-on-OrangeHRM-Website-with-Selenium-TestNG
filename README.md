## What is Automation?
### Automation is the process of using software tools and scripts to perform tasks that would typically be done manually by a human. In the context of software testing, automation involves using tools to execute test cases and compare the actual results with the expected results automatically.
## Why we use Selenium TestNG for Automation?
Selenium is a popular open-source testing tool widely used for automating web browsers. It allows developers and testers to automate web-based applications' testing across multiple browsers and platforms. Selenium provides a set of APIs to interact with web elements and manipulate their properties and behaviors, making it an ideal tool for automating UI tests.

TestNG is a testing framework for Java that is designed to be more flexible and powerful than JUnit. It supports a wide range of testing functionalities, including unit, integration, and end-to-end testing, as well as parallel execution, data-driven testing, and reporting. TestNG is often used with Selenium to create robust and scalable test automation frameworks.
